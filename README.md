# ðŸŽ¶ðŸ§  Raga Classification Using Deep Learning ðŸŽ¶ðŸ§ 

## Overview
Welcome to the "Raga Classification Using Deep Learning" repository! In this project, we delve into the fascinating realm of Indian classical music to classify ragas using deep learning techniques. Unlike Western music genres, ragas are complex modal structures with intricate ornamentations and improvisations, making their classification a unique challenge.

## Project Focus
The primary focus of this project is to leverage deep learning algorithms to accurately classify Indian classical ragas. This task involves specialized feature extraction and model selection due to the distinct characteristics of ragas. By using advanced techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, we aim to achieve high accuracy in raga classification.
